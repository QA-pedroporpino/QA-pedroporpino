## 🔍 About Me

Before I ever wrote a test script, I was already working with front-ends, backends, tech leads, data engineers.

I used to teach technical English for software developers at DevSpeak Academy, helping them improve communication in global development teams.
Today, I turn all that into tests that support real decisions.

I’ve worked on educational streaming platforms where I tested and automated complex flows using **Selenium with Python**, and **Cypress with JavaScript**.

Currently, I work at **Kompa Saúde**, a health tech company that uses AI to improve healthcare. There, I:
- Write automated tests with **Playwright and TypeScript**
- Run API tests using **Postman and Newman**
- Trigger automated test runs in the **cloud with GitHub Actions**

I’m passionate about building confidence in software, by preventing bugs before they ever reach production.

## 🎬 QA Series – *"Testing the Web"*

I'm creating a mini-series where I automate tests on globally recognized platforms, showing real-world problems and test strategies from a QA perspective:

- 🎧 **Episode 1** – Testing Spotify as a guest (releasing on **June 13, 2025**)  
- 🔐 **Episode 2** – Login flow validation on Netflix (coming soon...)
- 👟 **Episode 3** – Product filtering and checkout attempt on Nike.com (coming soon...)

Each episode comes with source code, a video demo, and a technical breakdown of the risks, validations, and impact.
